# PyBer Rideshare Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data from PyBer, a python-based ride-sharing app company, using the power of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The CEO of PyBer, V. Isualize, tasked us with creating a report to show how the company's ride-sharing data differs by city type. These differences will help the CEO and other key decision-makers at PyBer understand which city types will yield the most profit for a growing company.
